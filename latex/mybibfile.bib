	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for ﬁrst-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

To enable prediction of endogenous HLA class I-associated peptides across a large fraction of the human population, we used mass spectrometry to profile {\textgreater}185,000 peptides eluted from 95 HLA-A, -B, -C and -G mono-allelic cell lines. We identified canonical peptide motifs per HLA allele, unique and shared binding submotifs across alleles and distinct motifs associated with different peptide lengths. By integrating these data with transcript abundance and peptide processing, we developed HLAthena, providing allele-and-length-specific and pan-allele-pan-length prediction models for endogenous peptide presentation. These models predicted endogenous HLA class I-associated ligands with 1.5-fold improvement in positive predictive value compared with existing tools and correctly identified {\textgreater}75\% of HLA-bound peptides that were observed experimentally in 11 patient-derived tumor cell lines.},

In the last 3 years, public data sharing through PRIDE (as part of PX) has definitely become the norm in the field. In parallel, data re-use of public proteomics data has increased enormously, with multiple applications. We first describe the new architecture of PRIDE Archive, the archival component of PRIDE. PRIDE Archive and the related data submission framework have been further developed to support the increase in submitted data volumes and additional data types. A new scalable and fault tolerant storage backend, Application Programming Interface and web interface have been implemented, as a part of an ongoing process. Additionally, we emphasize the improved support for quantitative proteomics data through the mzTab format. At last, we outline key statistics on the current data contents and volume of downloads, and how PRIDE data are starting to be disseminated to added-value resources including Ensembl, UniProt and Expression Atlas.},

	abstract = {It is becoming increasingly recognized that experimental animal models, while useful to address monothematic biological questions, bear unpredictable relevance to human disease. Several reasons have been proposed. However, the uncontrollable nature of human genetics and the heterogeneity of disease that can only be replicated with difficulty experimentally play a leading role. Comparative immunology is a term that generally refers to the analysis of shared or diverging facets of immunology among species; these comparisons are carried out according to the principle that evolutionarily conserved themes outline biologic functions universally relevant for survival. We propose that a similar strategy could be applied to searching for themes shared by distinct immune pathologies within our own species. Identification of common patterns may outline pathways necessary for a particular determinism to occur, such as tissue-specific rejection or tolerance. This approach is founded on the unproven but sensible presumption that nature does not require an infinite plethora of redundant mechanisms to reach its purposes. Thus, immune pathologies must follow, at least in part, common means that determine their onset and maintenance. Commonalities among diseases can, in turn, be segregated from disease-specific patterns uncovering essential mechanisms that may represent universal targets for immunotherapy.},

The binding model achieves comparable performance with other well-acknowledged tools on the latest Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) benchmark datasets and an independent mass spectrometry (MS) dataset.

However, such biological drugs can lead to the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) that may result in adverse effects, including allergic reactions and compromised therapeutic efficacy. Production of ADAs is most often associated with activation of CD4 T cell–dependent immune responses resulting from proteolysis of the biotherapeutic and loading of drug specific peptides into major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on professional antigen presenting cells. Recently, readouts from MHC-associated peptide proteomics (MAPPs) assays have been shown to correlate with the presence of CD4 T cell epitopes. However, the limited sensitivity of MAPPs assays challenges its use as an immunogenicity biomarker. In this work, MAPPs data was used to construct an artificial neural network (ANN) model for MHC class II antigen presentation. Using Infliximab and Rituximab as a showcase stories, the model demonstrated an unprecedented performance for predicting MAPPs and CD4 T cell epitopes, complementing results from MAPPs assays and outperforming conventional prediction models trained on binding affinity data.},

	abstract = {The identification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-binding peptides in mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptideomics relies largely on database search engines developed for proteomics data analysis. However, because immunopeptidomics experiments do not involve enzymatic digestion at specific residues, an inflated search space leads to a high false positive rate and low sensitivity in peptide identification. In order to improve the sensitivity and reliability of peptide identification, a post-processing tool named DeepRescore is developed. DeepRescore combines peptide features derived from deep learning predictions, namely accurate retention timeand MS/MS spectra predictions, with previously used features to rescore peptide-spectrum matches. Using two public immunopeptidomics datasets, it is shown that rescoring by DeepRescore increases both the sensitivity and reliability of MHC-binding peptide and neoantigen identifications compared to existing methods. It is also shown that the performance improvement is, to a large extent, driven by the deep learning-derived features.

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of antigen presentation by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules would be valuable for vaccine development and cancer immunotherapies. Current computational methods trained on in vitro binding data are limited by insufficient training data and algorithmic constraints. Here we describe MARIA (major histocompatibility complex analysis with recurrent integrated architecture; https://maria.stanford.edu/), a multimodal recurrent neural network for predicting the likelihood of antigen presentation from a gene of interest in the context of specific HLA class II alleles. In addition to in vitro binding measurements, MARIA is trained on peptide HLA ligand sequences identified by mass spectrometry, expression levels of antigen genes and protease cleavage signatures. Because it leverages these diverse training data and our improved machine learning framework, MARIA (area under the curve = 0.89–0.92) outperformed existing methods in validation datasets. Across independent cancer neoantigen studies, peptides with high MARIA scores are more likely to elicit strong CD4+ T cell responses. MARIA allows identification of immunogenic epitopes in diverse cancers and autoimmune disease.},

	abstract = {Epitopes that arise from a somatic mutation, also called neoepitopes, are now known to play a key role in cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have made it possible to identify all mutations and thereby all potential neoepitope candidates in an individual cancer. However, most of these neoepitope candidates are not recognized by T cells of cancer patients when tested in vivo or in vitro, meaning they are not immunogenic. Especially in patients with a high mutational load, usually hundreds of potential neoepitopes are detected, highlighting the need to further narrow down this candidate list. In our study, we assembled a dataset of known, naturally processed, immunogenic neoepitopes to dissect the properties that make these neoepitopes immunogenic. The tools to use and thresholds to apply for prioritizing neoepitopes have so far been largely based on experience with epitope identification in other settings such as infectious disease and allergy. Here, we performed a detailed analysis on our dataset of curated immunogenic neoepitopes to establish the appropriate tools and thresholds in the cancer setting. To this end, we evaluated different predictors for parameters that play a role in a neoepitope’s immunogenicity and suggest that using binding predictions and length-rescaling yields the best performance in discriminating immunogenic neoepitopes from a background set of mutated peptides. We furthermore show that almost all neoepitopes had strong predicted binding affinities (as expected), but more surprisingly, the corresponding non-mutated peptides had nearly as high affinities. Our results provide a rational basis for parameters in neoepitope filtering approaches that are being commonly used.

The number of immunotherapy drug approvals has been increasing, with numerous treatments in clinical and preclinical development. However, a key challenge in the broad implementation of immunotherapies for cancer remains the controlled modulation of the immune system, as these therapeutics have serious adverse effects including autoimmunity and nonspecific inflammation. Understanding how to increase the response rates to various classes of immunotherapy is key to improving efficacy and controlling these adverse effects. Advanced biomaterials and drug delivery systems, such as nanoparticles and the use of T cells to deliver therapies, could effectively harness immunotherapies and improve their potency while reducing toxic side effects. Here, we discuss these research advances, as well as the opportunities and challenges for integrating delivery technologies into cancer immunotherapy, and we critically analyse the outlook for these emerging areas.},

The divergent allele advantage hypothesis dictates that an HLA-I genotype with two alleles with sequences that are more divergent enables presentation of more diverse immunopeptidomes1–3. However, the effect of sequence divergence between HLA-I alleles—a quantifiable measure of HLA-I evolution—on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment for cancer remains unknown. In the present study the germline HLA-I evolutionary divergence (HED) of patients with cancer treated with ICIs was determined by quantifying the physiochemical sequence divergence between HLA-I alleles of each patient’s genotype. HED was a strong determinant of survival after treatment with ICIs. Even among patients fully heterozygous at HLA-I, patients with an HED in the upper quartile respond better to ICIs than patients with a low HED. Furthermore, HED strongly impacts the diversity of tumor, viral and self-immunopeptidomes and intratumoral T cell receptor clonality. Similar to tumor mutation burden, HED is a fundamental metric of diversity at the major histocompatibility complex–peptide complex, which dictates ICI efficacy. The data link divergent HLA allele advantage to immunotherapy efficacy and unveil how ICI response relies on the evolved efficiency of HLA-mediated immunity.},

Abstract:
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

DeepLigand combines a peptide language model and peptide binding affinity prediction to score MHC class I peptide presentation. The peptide language model characterizes sequence features that correspond to secondary factors in MHC ligand selection other than binding affinity. The peptide embedding is learned by pre-training on natural ligands, and can discriminate between ligands and non-ligands in the absence of binding affinity prediction. Although conventional affinity-based models fail to classify peptides with moderate affinities, DeepLigand discriminates ligands from non-ligands with consistently high accuracy.We make DeepLigand available at https://github.com/gifford-lab/DeepLigand.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, the multitude of available prediction tools makes it non-trivial for the end-user to select which tool to use for a given task. To provide a solid basis on which to compare different prediction tools, we here describe a framework for the automated benchmarking of peptide-MHC class I binding prediction tools. The framework runs weekly benchmarks on data that are newly entered into the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), giving the public access to frequent, up-to-date performance evaluations of all participating tools. To overcome potential selection bias in the data included in the IEDB, a strategy was implemented that suggests a set of peptides for which different prediction methods give divergent predictions as to their binding capability. Upon experimental binding validation, these peptides entered the benchmark study.Results: The benchmark has run for 15 weeks and includes evaluation of 44 datasets covering 17 MHC alleles and more than 4000 peptide-MHC binding measurements. Inspection of the results allows the end-user to make educated selections between participating tools. Of the four participating servers, NetMHCpan performed the best, followed by ANN, SMM and finally ARB.Availability and implementation: Up-to-date performance evaluations of each server can be found online at http://tools.iedb.org/auto\_bench/mhci/weekly.

	abstract = {Binding of peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules is the single most selective step in the recognition of pathogens by the cellular immune system. The human MHC genomic region (called HLA) is extremely polymorphic comprising several thousand alleles, each encoding a distinct MHC molecule. The potentially unique specificity of the majority of HLA alleles that have been identified to date remains uncharacterized. Likewise, only a limited number of chimpanzee and rhesus macaque MHC class I molecules have been characterized experimentally. Here, we present NetMHCpan-2.0, a method that generates quantitative predictions of the affinity of any peptide–MHC class I interaction. NetMHCpan-2.0 has been trained on the hitherto largest set of quantitative MHC binding data available, covering HLA-A and HLA-B, as well as chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, gorilla, and mouse MHC class I molecules. We show that the NetMHCpan-2.0 method can accurately predict binding to uncharacterized HLA molecules, including HLA-C and HLA-G. Moreover, NetMHCpan-2.0 is demonstrated to accurately predict peptide binding to chimpanzee and macaque MHC class I molecules. The power of NetMHCpan-2.0 to guide immunologists in interpreting cellular immune responses in large out-bred populations is demonstrated. Further, we used NetMHCpan-2.0 to predict potential binding peptides for the pig MHC class I molecule SLA-1*0401. Ninety-three percent of the predicted peptides were demonstrated to bind stronger than 500 nM. The high performance of NetMHCpan-2.0 for non-human primates documents the method’s ability to provide broad allelic coverage also beyond human MHC molecules. The method is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan.},

	abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are expressed on the cell surface, where they present peptides to T cells, which gives them a key role in the development of T-cell immune responses. MHC molecules come in two main variants: MHC Class I (MHC-I) and MHC Class II (MHC-II). MHC-I predominantly present peptides derived from intracellular proteins, whereas MHC-II predominantly presents peptides from extracellular proteins. In both cases, the binding between MHC and antigenic peptides is the most selective step in the antigen presentation pathway. Therefore, the prediction of peptide binding to MHC is a powerful utility to predict the possible specificity of a T-cell immune response. Commonly MHC binding prediction tools are trained on binding affinity or mass spectrometry-eluted ligands. Recent studies have however demonstrated how the integration of both data types can boost predictive performances. Inspired by this, we here present NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCIIpan-4.0, two web servers created to predict binding between peptides and MHC-I and MHC-II, respectively. Both methods exploit tailored machine learning strategies to integrate different training data types, resulting in state-of-the-art performance and outperforming their competitors. The servers are available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan-4.1/ and http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan-4.0/.},

Here, the authors present a homogenous, proximity-based assay for detection of peptide binding to HLA class I molecules. It uses a conformation-dependent anti-HLA class I antibody, W6/32, as one tag and a biotinylated recombinant HLA class I molecule as the other tag, and a proximity-based signal is generated through the luminescent oxygen channeling immunoassay technology (abbreviated LOCI and commercialized as AlphaScreen™). Compared with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay—based peptide-HLA class I binding assay, the LOCI assay yields virtually identical affinity measurements, although having a broader dynamic range, better signal-to-background ratios, and a higher capacity. They also describe an efficient approach to screen peptides for binding to HLA molecules. For the occasional user, this will serve as a robust, simple peptide-HLA binding assay. For the more dedicated user, it can easily be performed in a high-throughput screening mode using standard liquid handling robotics and 384-well plates. We have successfully applied this assay to more than 60 different HLA molecules, leading to more than 2 million measurements. (Journal of Biomolecular Screening 2009:173-180)},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The set of peptides presented on a cell's surface by MHC molecules is known as the immunopeptidome. Current mass spectrometry technologies allow for identification of large peptidomes, and studies have proven these data to be a rich source of information for learning the rules of MHC-mediated antigen presentation. Immunopeptidomes are usually poly-specific, containing multiple sequence motifs matching the MHC molecules expressed in the system under investigation. Motif deconvolution -the process of associating each ligand to its presenting MHC molecule(s)- is therefore a critical and challenging step in the analysis of MS-eluted MHC ligand data. Here, we describe NNAlign\_MA, a computational method designed to address this challenge and fully benefit from large, poly-specific data sets of MS-eluted ligands. NNAlign\_MA simultaneously performs the tasks of (1) clustering peptides into individual specificities; (2) automatic annotation of each cluster to an MHC molecule; and (3) training of a prediction model covering all MHCs present in the training set. NNAlign\_MA was benchmarked on large and diverse data sets, covering class I and class II data. In all cases, the method was demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art methods, effectively expanding the coverage of alleles for which accurate predictions can be made, resulting in improved identification of both eluted ligands and T-cell epitopes. Given its high flexibility and ease of use, we expect NNAlign\_MA to serve as an effective tool to increase our understanding of the rules of MHC antigen presentation and guide the development of novel T-cell-based therapeutics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We dissect the emerging approaches using deep learning techniques for protein structural modeling and discuss advances and challenges that must be addressed. We argue for the central importance of structure, following the ‘‘sequence / structure / function’’ paradigm. This review is directed to help both computational biologists to gain familiarity with the deep learning methods applied in protein modeling, and computer scientists to gain perspective on the biologically meaningful problems that may beneﬁt from deep learning techniques.},

	abstract = {Immunoinformatics is a discipline that applies methods of computer science to study and model the immune system. A fundamental question addressed by immunoinformatics is how to understand the rules of antigen presentation by MHC molecules to T cells, a process that is central to adaptive immune responses to infections and cancer. In the modern era of personalized medicine, the ability to model and predict which antigens can be presented by MHC is key to manipulating the immune system and designing strategies for therapeutic intervention. Since the MHC is both polygenic and extremely polymorphic, each individual possesses a personalized set of MHC molecules with different peptide-binding specificities, and collectively they present a unique individualized peptide imprint of the ongoing protein metabolism. Mapping all MHC allotypes is an enormous undertaking that cannot be achieved without a strong bioinformatics component. Computational tools for the prediction of peptide–MHC binding have thus become essential in most pipelines for T cell epitope discovery and an inescapable component of vaccine and cancer research. Here, we describe the development of several such tools, from pioneering efforts to the current state-of-the-art methods, that have allowed for accurate predictions of peptide binding of all MHC molecules, even including those that have not yet been characterized experimentally.},

To enrich for neoantigens with the greatest likelihood of immunogenicity, we developed an analytic method to parse neoantigen quality through rational biological criteria across five clinical datasets for 318 cancer patients. We explored four quality metrics, including analysis of dissimilarity to the non-mutated proteome that was predictive of peptide immunogenicity. In patient tumors, neoantigens with high dissimilarity were unique, enriched for hydrophobic sequences, and correlated with survival after PD-1 checkpoint therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer independent of predicted MHC affinity. We incorporated our neoantigen quality analysis methodology into an open-source tool, antigen.garnish, to predict immunogenic peptides from bulk computationally predicted neoantigens for which the immunogenic “hit rate” is currently low.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93\%±0.06\% is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8\% accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0\% accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about protein structure can be determined. Importantly, this model needs to be trained only once and can then be applied to extract a comprehensive set of information regarding proteins of interest. Moreover, this representation can be considered as pre-training for various applications of deep learning in bioinformatics.

	abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) presented peptide epitopes provide a ‘window’ into the changes occurring in a cell. Conventionally, these peptides are generated by proteolysis of endogenously synthesized proteins in the cytosol, loaded onto MHC-I molecules, and presented on the cell surface for surveillance by CD8+ T cells. MHC-I restricted processing and presentation alerts the immune system to any infectious or tumorigenic processes unfolding intracellularly and provides potential targets for a cytotoxic T cell response. Therefore, therapeutic vaccines based on MHC-I presented peptide epitopes could, theoretically, induce CD8+ T cell responses that have tangible clinical impacts on tumor eradication and patient survival. Three major methods have been used to identify MHC-I restricted epitopes for inclusion in peptide-based vaccines for cancer: genetic, motif prediction and, more recently, immunoproteomic analysis. Although the first two methods are capable of identifying T cell stimulatory epitopes, these have significant disadvantages and may not accurately represent epitopes presented by a tumor cell. In contrast, immunoproteomic methods can overcome these disadvantages and identify naturally processed and presented tumor associated epitopes that induce more clinically relevant tumor specific cytotoxic T cell responses. In this review, we discuss the importance of using the naturally presented MHC-I peptide repertoire in formulating peptide vaccines, the recent application of peptide-based vaccines in a variety of cancers, and highlight the pros and cons of the current state of peptide vaccines.},

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

	abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classiﬁcation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5\% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).},

	abstract = {Machine learning applied to protein sequences is an increasingly popular area of research. Semi-supervised learning for proteins has emerged as an important paradigm due to the high cost of acquiring supervised protein labels, but the current literature is fragmented when it comes to datasets and standardized evaluation techniques. To facilitate progress in this field, we introduce the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings (TAPE), a set of five biologically relevant semi-supervised learning tasks spread across different domains of protein biology. We curate tasks into specific training, validation, and test splits to ensure that each task tests biologically relevant generalization that transfers to real-life scenarios. We benchmark a range of approaches to semi-supervised protein representation learning, which span recent work as well as canonical sequence learning techniques. We find that self-supervised pretraining is helpful for almost all models on all tasks, more than doubling performance in some cases. Despite this increase, in several cases features learned by self-supervised pretraining still lag behind features extracted by state-of-the-art non-neural techniques. This gap in performance suggests a huge opportunity for innovative architecture design and improved modeling paradigms that better capture the signal in biological sequences. TAPE will help the machine learning community focus effort on scientifically relevant problems.

Extensive tests have demonstrated that ACME can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art prediction methods with an increase of the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and measured binding affinities by up to 23 percentage points. In addition, its ability to identify strong-binding peptides has been experimentally validated. Moreover, by integrating the convolutional neural network with attention mechanism, ACME is able to extract interpretable patterns that can provide useful and detailed insights into the binding preferences between peptides and their MHC partners.

Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is a deep learning method inspired by visual recognition process of animal brain and it is known to be able to capture meaningful local patterns from 2D images. Once the peptide-MHC interactions can be encoded into image-like array(ILA) data, DCNN can be employed to build a predictive model for peptide-MHC binding prediction. In this study, we demonstrated that DCNN is able to not only reliably predict peptide-MHC binding, but also sensitively detect locally-clustered interactions.},

However, a key obstacle is the ambiguity that arises from the co-expression of multiple HLA alleles. Here, we have implemented a scalable mono-allelic strategy for profiling the HLA peptidome. By using cell lines expressing a single HLA allele, optimizing immunopurifications, and developing an application-specific spectral search algorithm, we identified thousands of peptides bound to 16 different HLA class I alleles. These data enabled the discovery of subdominant binding motifs and an integrative analysis quantifying the contribution of factors critical to epitope presentation, such as protein cleavage and gene expression. We trained neural-network prediction algorithms with our large dataset ({\textgreater}24,000 peptides) and outperformed algorithms trained on datasets of peptides with measured affinities. We thus demonstrate a strategy for systematically learning the rules of endogenous antigen presentation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While extensive research has focused on functional architectures for representing words and sentences, there is less work on representing arbitrary spans of text within sentences. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of six span representation methods using eight pretrained language representation models across six tasks, including two tasks that we introduce. We find that, although some simple span representations are fairly reliable across tasks, in general the optimal span representation varies by task, and can also vary within different facets of individual tasks. We also find that the choice of span representation has a bigger impact with a fixed pretrained encoder than with a fine-tuned encoder.},

	abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large locus on vertebrate DNA containing a set of closely linked polymorphic genes that code for cell surface proteins essential for the adaptive immune system. These cell surface proteins are called MHC molecules.
This locus got its name because it was discovered via the study of transplanted tissue compatibility. Later studies revealed that tissue rejection due to incompatibility is an experimental artifact masking the real function of MHC molecules - binding an antigen derived from self-proteins, or from pathogens, and bringing the antigen presentation to the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. MHC molecules mediate the interactions of leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs), with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines donor compatibility for organ transplant, as well as one's susceptibility to autoimmune diseases via cross-reacting immunization.
In a cell, protein molecules of the host's own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded. Each MHC molecule on the cell surface displays a small peptide (a molecular fraction of a protein) called an epitope. The presented self-antigens prevent an organism's immune system from targeting its own cells. The presentation of pathogen-derived proteins results in the elimination of the infected cell by the immune system.
Diversity of an individual's self-antigen presentation, mediated by MHC self-antigens, is attained in at least three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repertoire is polygenic (via multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); (3) MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (diversely varying from organism to organism within a species). Sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing, which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.},

The human MHC class I system (HLA-I) is extremely polymorphic. The number of registered HLA-I molecules has now surpassed 1500. Characterizing the specificity of each separately would be a major undertaking.Principal FindingsHere, we have drawn on a large database of known peptide-HLA-I interactions to develop a bioinformatics method, which takes both peptide and HLA sequence information into account, and generates quantitative predictions of the affinity of any peptide-HLA-I interaction. Prospective experimental validation of peptides predicted to bind to previously untested HLA-I molecules, cross-validation, and retrospective prediction of known HIV immune epitopes and endogenous presented peptides, all successfully validate this method. We further demonstrate that the method can be applied to perform a clustering analysis of MHC specificities and suggest using this clustering to select particularly informative novel MHC molecules for future biochemical and functional analysis.ConclusionsEncompassing all HLA molecules, this high-throughput computational method lends itself to epitope searches that are not only genome- and pathogen-wide, but also HLA-wide. Thus, it offers a truly global analysis of immune responses supporting rational development of vaccines and immunotherapy. It also promises to provide new basic insights into HLA structure-function relationships. The method is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan.},

NNAlign is a method for the identification of such linear motifs in biological sequences. The algorithm aligns the amino acid or nucleotide sequences provided as training set, and generates a model of the sequence motif detected in the data. The webserver allows setting up cross-validation experiments to estimate the performance of the model, as well as evaluations on independent data. Many features of the training sequences can be encoded as input, and the network architecture is highly customizable. The results returned by the server include a graphical representation of the motif identified by the method, performance values and a downloadable model that can be applied to scan protein sequences for occurrence of the motif. While its performance for the characterization of peptide–MHC interactions is widely documented, we extended NNAlign to be applicable to other receptor–ligand systems as well. Version 2.0 supports alignments with insertions and deletions, encoding of receptor pseudo-sequences, and custom alphabets for the training sequences.

Here, by exploiting co-occurrence of HLA-I alleles across ten newly generated as well as forty public HLA peptidomics datasets comprising more than 115,000 unique peptides, we show that we can rapidly and accurately identify many HLA-I binding motifs and map them to their corresponding alleles without any a priori knowledge of HLA-I binding specificity. Our approach recapitulates and refines known motifs for 43 of the most frequent alleles, uncovers new motifs for 9 alleles that up to now had less than five known ligands and provides a scalable framework to incorporate additional HLA peptidomics studies in the future. The refined motifs improve neo-antigen and cancer testis antigen predictions, indicating that unbiased HLA peptidomics data are ideal for in silico predictions of neo-antigens from tumor exome sequencing data. The new motifs further reveal distant modulation of the binding specificity at P2 for some HLA-I alleles by residues in the HLA-I binding site but outside of the B-pocket and we unravel the underlying mechanisms by protein structure analysis, mutagenesis and in vitro binding assays.},

Because of this ability to induce and direct a potent and tumour-specific immune response while minimizing autoimmunity, a cancer vaccine may be an effective combinatorial partner with immune checkpoint blockade or other immune therapeutics.A successful cancer vaccine has four key components, each of which is crucial to its effectiveness: tumour antigens, formulations, immune adjuvants and delivery vehicles. For each of these components, various approaches have been tested preclinically and in hundreds of clinical trials in patients, with limited therapeutic success so far.Neoantigens have emerged as targets of effective tumour-directed T cell responses. Increased neoantigen load is associated with improved patient outcomes, and neoantigen-reactive T cell populations expand in settings of effective immunotherapy and mediate tumour cell killing in preclinical models and patients.Three clinical trials of neoantigen-based vaccines in patients with melanoma, using dendritic cells loaded with short peptides, long peptides or RNA, have shown the safety, feasibility and robust immunogenicity of this approach.A crucial aspect of a vaccine targeting neoantigens is the selection of epitopes that can be presented in vivo by tumour or antigen-presenting cells. HLA-binding prediction, high-resolution mass spectrometry and understanding of antigen processing are important research areas for further discovery.Optimal neoantigen delivery — use of the most effective formulations, immune adjuvants, delivery vehicles and dosing — in combination with complementary therapies will be crucial for maximum therapeutic effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Cytotoxic T cells are of central importance in the immune system’s response to disease. They recognize defective cells by binding to peptides presented on the cell surface by MHC class I molecules. Peptide binding to MHC molecules is the single most selective step in the Ag-presentation pathway. Therefore, in the quest for T cell epitopes, the prediction of peptide binding to MHC molecules has attracted widespread attention. In the past, predictors of peptide–MHC interactions have primarily been trained on binding affinity data. Recently, an increasing number of MHC-presented peptides identified by mass spectrometry have been reported containing information about peptide-processing steps in the presentation pathway and the length distribution of naturally presented peptides. In this article, we present NetMHCpan-4.0, a method trained on binding affinity and eluted ligand data leveraging the information from both data types. Large-scale benchmarking of the method demonstrates an increase in predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods when it comes to identification of naturally processed ligands, cancer neoantigens, and T cell epitopes.},

	abstract = {Large pre-trained neural networks such as BERT have had great recent success in NLP, motivating a growing body of research investigating what aspects of language they are able to learn from unlabeled data. Most recent analysis has focused on model outputs (e.g., language model surprisal) or internal vector representations (e.g., probing classifiers). Complementary to these works, we propose methods for analyzing the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models and apply them to BERT. BERT's attention heads exhibit patterns such as attending to delimiter tokens, specific positional offsets, or broadly attending over the whole sentence, with heads in the same layer often exhibiting similar behaviors. We further show that certain attention heads correspond well to linguistic notions of syntax and coreference. For example, we find heads that attend to the direct objects of verbs, determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions, and coreferent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly, we propose an attention-based probing classifier and use it to further demonstrate that substantial syntactic information is captured in BERT's attention.},

The recently proposed network architecture of the Transformer is based entirely on attention mechanisms and achieves new state of the art results in neural machine translation, outperforming other sequence-to-sequence models. However, so far not much is known about the internal properties of the model and the representations it learns to achieve that performance. To study this question, we investigate the information that is learned by the attention mechanism in Transformer models with different translation quality. We assess the representations of the encoder by extracting dependency relations based on self-attention weights, we perform four probing tasks to study the amount of syntactic and semantic captured information and we also test attention in a transfer learning scenario. Our analysis sheds light on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various encoder representations. We observe that specific attention heads mark syntactic dependency relations and we can also confirm that lower layers tend to learn more about syntax while higher layers tend to encode more semantics.},

	abstract = {Computational biology and bioinformatics provide vast data gold-mines from protein sequences, ideal for Language Models taken from NLP. These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81\%-87\%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81\%) and membrane vs. water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91\%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches. Taken together, the results implied that protein LMs learned some of the grammar of the language of life.

However, analyses have to catch up with the rapid release of new models and the growing diversity of investigation techniques. To support analysis for a wide variety of models, we introduce EXBERT, a tool to help humans conduct ﬂexible, interactive investigations and formulate hypotheses for the model-internal reasoning process. EXBERT provides insights into the meaning of the contextual representations and attention by matching a humanspeciﬁed input to similar contexts in large annotated datasets.

	abstract = {Background There has been a surge in studies linking genome structure and gene expression, with special focus on duplicated genes. Although initially duplicated from the same sequence, duplicated genes can diverge strongly over evolution and take on different functions or regulated expression. However, information on the function and expression of duplicated genes remains sparse. Identifying groups of duplicated genes in different genomes and characterizing their expression and function would therefore be of great interest to the research community. The ‘Duplicated Genes Database’ (DGD) was developed for this purpose. Methodology Nine species were included in the DGD. For each species, BLAST analyses were conducted on peptide sequences corresponding to the genes mapped on a same chromosome. Groups of duplicated genes were defined based on these pairwise BLAST comparisons and the genomic location of the genes. For each group, Pearson correlations between gene expression data and semantic similarities between functional GO annotations were also computed when the relevant information was available. Conclusions The Duplicated Gene Database provides a list of co-localised and duplicated genes for several species with the available gene co-expression level and semantic similarity value of functional annotation. Adding these data to the groups of duplicated genes provides biological information that can prove useful to gene expression analyses. The Duplicated Gene Database can be freely accessed through the DGD website at http://dgd.genouest.org.},

	abstract = {Motivation : High-content screening (HCS) technologies have enabled large scale imaging experiments for studying cell biology and for drug screening. These systems produce hundreds of thousands of microscopy images per day and their utility depends on automated image analysis. Recently, deep learning approaches that learn feature representations directly from pixel intensity values have dominated object recognition challenges. These tasks typically have a single centered object per image and existing models are not directly applicable to microscopy datasets. Here we develop an approach that combines deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multiple instance learning (MIL) in order to classify and segment microscopy images using only whole image level annotations. Results : We introduce a new neural network architecture that uses MIL to simultaneously classify and segment microscopy images with populations of cells. We base our approach on the similarity between the aggregation function used in MIL and pooling layers used in CNNs. To facilitate aggregating across large numbers of instances in CNN feature maps we present the Noisy-AND pooling function, a new MIL operator that is robust to outliers. Combining CNNs with MIL enables training CNNs using whole microscopy images with image level labels. We show that training end-to-end MIL CNNs outperforms several previous methods on both mammalian and yeast datasets without requiring any segmentation steps.

Transfer of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) has been investigated as a method of boosting T cell responses in therapeutic vaccines for several diseases. Tanyi et al. report the findings of a clinical study involving recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Patient DCs were pulsed with oxidized tumor lysate before transfer and given alone or in combination with immunomodulatory drugs. The DC vaccine was well tolerated and induced potent antitumor T cell responses, including to new epitopes, that correlated with better prognosis. These results suggest further testing of this vaccination regimen for inducing protective T cell immunity in cancer.
Personalized cancer vaccines induce antitumor T cells that correlate with clinical benefit in patients with ovarian cancer.

An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life-threatening pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict non-native peptides to elicit a T-cell response, however, we currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen alleles, for both synthetic biological applications, and to augment real training datasets. Here, we propose a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive peptide immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, Random Forest and AdaBoost) and three deep learning models (convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual Net and graph neural network) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-CoV-2). We chose the CNN as the best prediction model, based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to outperforming two highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepImmuno-CNN correctly predicts which residues are most important for T-cell antigen recognition and predicts novel impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our independent generative adversarial network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides with physicochemical properties and immunogenicity predictions similar to that of real antigens. We provide DeepImmuno-CNN as source code and an easy-to-use web interface.},

New technologies, including genome-wide small interfering RNA screens and systems biology approaches, have identified numerous additional pathways that control antigen presentation by MHC molecules.MHC molecules are polymorphic, and the biology of the various alleles differs, such that they can potentially have different consequences with regards to the relevant immune responses. This point is best-defined for MHC class I molecules. In this Review, we bring this into context with the current understanding of the general MHC class I antigen presentation process.The biology of MHC molecules touches almost all areas in the field of cell biology. Various new findings from the area of cell biology have consequences for MHC class I and MHC class II antigen presentation.The immune system is a relatively late addition in our progress through evolution, and many immune-specific molecules exist. Unique functions of some of these, including the immunoproteasome in interferon-induced damage clearance, have been recently uncovered.Through a combination of small interfering RNA screens, microarrays and cell biological approaches, novel pathways that control MHC class II expression and transport in dendritic cells have been defined. The systems biology of MHC molecules will yield more surprises.A dynamic field of research has many unsolved issues. A survey of the views of almost 50 group leaders in the field of antigen presentation has provided democratic opinions on the variety of unsettled topics within the field.},

Aspects such as the internalization route, the pathway of endocytic trafficking and the simultaneous activation through pattern-recognition receptors have a determining influence in how antigens are handled for cross-presentation by DCs.

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

The formation of a peptide-MHC complex is the initial step in specific, T cell-mediated immune responses. But, unlike other receptor-ligand systems, peptides are essential for a stable conformation of the MHC proteins. To investigate the contribution of every amino acid of octapeptides to the stability and antigenic integrity of MHC proteins, complex octapeptide libraries with one defined amino acid and mixtures of 19 amino acids in the remaining seven positions were synthesized and tested for their capacity to stabilize the conformation of the mouse MHC class I molecule H-2Kb. Peptide transporter-deficient RMA-S cells were employed in this study. Amino acid preferences found for the eight sequence positions reveal constitutional, volumetric, and steric constraints that govern peptide selection by MHC molecules. The pattern of amino acid preferences indicates that the peptides behave as integral parts of the MHC proteins and follow rules established for the interrelationship of primary sequence and the conformation and stability of proteins in general.},

This approach provides means to assess semiquantitatively the contribution of every amino acid to the binding of peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules without biases introduced by naturally processed peptides. Primary and secondary anchor residues were defined for their major contribution to the binding efficiency of the peptides. In contrast to primary anchors, secondary anchor amino acids vary greatly in their side chains and position in the sequences. All amino acids in the octapeptide sequences were found to exhibit positive or negative influences on binding to the MHC molecules and on recognition of the resulting complexes by CTLs. Strong interdependence of the effects of the individual residues in the epitope sequences was demonstrated. CTL responses to peptide libraries were suppressed when residues were introduced; however, they were augmented when the critical residues for T cell recognition were fixed, suggesting a potential use of the peptide libraries for defining epitope sequences in general.},

	abstract = {Peptide-based vaccine development needs accurate pre-diction of the binding affinity between major histocom-patibility complex I (MHC I) proteins and their peptide ligands. Nowadays more and more machine learning methods have been developed to predict binding affinity and some of them have become the popular tools. How-ever most of them are designed by the shallow neural networks. As Bengio said that deep neural networks can learn better fits with less data than shallow neural net-works. In our case, some of the alleles only have dozens of peptides data. In addition, we transform each peptide into a characteristic matrix and input it into the model. As we know when dealing with the problem that the input is a matrix, CNN can find the most critical features by itself. Obviously, compared with the traditional neural network model, CNN is more suitable for predicting binding affin-ity. Different from the previous studies which are based on BLOSUM, we used novel feature to do the prediction. Since we consider that the order of the sequence, hy-dropathy index, polarity and the length of the peptide could affect the binding affinity and the properties of these amino acids are key factors for their binding to MHC, we extracted these information from each peptide. In order to make full use of the data we have obtained, we have integrated different length of peptides into 15mer based on the binding mode of peptide to MHC I. In order to demonstrate that our method is reliable to pre-dict pep-tide-MHC binding, we compared our method with several popular methods. The experiments show the superiority of our method.},

	abstract = {Of the many thousands of peptides encoded by a complex foreign antigen that can potentially be presented to CD8+ T cells (TCD8+), only a small fraction induce measurable responses in association with any given major histocompatibility complex class I allele. To design vaccines that elicit optimal TCD8+ responses, a thorough understanding of this phenomenon, known as immunodominance, is imperative. Here we review recent progress in unraveling the molecular and cellular basis for immunodominance. Of foremost importance is peptide binding to class I molecules; only ∼1/200 of potential determinants bind at greater than the threshold affinity (Kd {\textgreater} 500 nM) associated with immunogenicity. Limitations in the TCD8+ repertoire render approximately half of these peptides nonimmunogenic, and inefficient antigen processing further thins the ranks by approximately four fifths. As a result, only ∼1/2000 of the peptides in a foreign antigen expressed by an appropriate antigen presenting cell achieve immunodominant status with a given class I allele. A roughly equal fraction of peptides have subdominant status, i.e. they induce weak-to-nondetectable primary TCD8+ responses in the context of their natural antigen. Subdominant determinants may be expressed at or above levels of immunodominant determinants, at least on antigen presenting cells in vitro. The immunogenicity of subdominant determinants is often limited by immunodomination: suppression mediated by TCD8+ specific for immunodominant determinants. Immunodomination is a central feature of TCD8+ responses, as it even occurs among clones responding to the same immunodominant determinant. Little is known about how immunodominant and subdominant determinants are distinguished by the TCD8+ repertoire, or how (and why) immunodomination occurs, but new tools are available to address these questions.},

	abstract = {Increasing the size of a neural network typically improves accuracy but also increases the memory and compute requirements for training the model. We introduce methodology for training deep neural networks using half-precision ﬂoating point numbers, without losing model accuracy or having to modify hyperparameters. This nearly halves memory requirements and, on recent GPUs, speeds up arithmetic. Weights, activations, and gradients are stored in IEEE halfprecision format. Since this format has a narrower range than single-precision we propose three techniques for preventing the loss of critical information. Firstly, we recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of weights that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step (this copy is rounded to half-precision for the forward- and back-propagation). Secondly, we propose loss-scaling to preserve gradient values with small magnitudes. Thirdly, we use half-precision arithmetic that accumulates into single-precision outputs, which are converted to halfprecision before storing to memory. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology works across a wide variety of tasks and modern large scale (exceeding 100 million parameters) model architectures, trained on large datasets.},

To make the model more accessible, we introduce an open-source tool that visualizes attention at multiple scales, each of which provides a unique perspective on the attention mechanism.

However, due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, they are not transparent, i.e., it is hard to grasp what makes them arrive at a particular classification or recognition decision, given a new unseen data sample. Recently, several approaches have been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These methods quantify the “importance” of individual pixels with respect to the classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space. While the usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively by a human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this paper, we present a general methodology based on region perturbation for evaluating ordered collections of pixels such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012, and MIT Places data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method. We provide theoretical arguments to explain this result and discuss its practical implications. Finally, we investigate the use of heatmaps for unsupervised assessment of the neural network performance.},

	abstract = {Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) perceive the world through small peptides that are eight to ten amino acids long. These peptides (epitopes) are initially generated by the proteasome, a multi-subunit protease that is responsible for the majority of intra-cellular protein degradation. The proteasome generates the exact C-terminal of CTL epitopes, and the N-terminal with a possible extension. CTL responses may diminish if the epitopes are destroyed by the proteasomes. Therefore, the prediction of the proteasome cleavage sites is important to identify potential immunogenic regions in the proteomes of pathogenic microorganisms (or humans). We have recently shown that NetChop, a neural network-based prediction method, is the best method available at the moment to do such predictions; however, its performance is still lower than desired. Here, we use novel sequence encoding methods and show that the new version of NetChop predicts approximately 10\% more of the cleavage sites correctly while lowering the number of false positives with close to 15\%. With this more reliable prediction tool, we study two important questions concerning the function of the proteasome. First, we estimate the N-terminal extension of epitopes after proteasomal cleavage and find that the average extension is relatively short. However, more than 30\% of the peptides have N-terminal extensions of three amino acids or more, and thus, N-terminal trimming might play an important role in the presentation of a substantial fraction of the epitopes. Second, we show that good TAP ligands have an increased chance of being cleaved by the proteasome, i.e., the specificity of TAP has evolved to fit the specificity of the proteasome. This evolutionary relationship allows for a more efficient antigen presentation.},

In cells stimulated with gamma interferon , the active proteasome subunits are replaced by "immuno" subunits that form immunoproteasomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the immunosubunits has revealed that they evolve faster than their constitutive counterparts. This suggests that the immunoproteasome has evolved a function that differs from that of the constitutive proteasome. Accumulating experimental degradation data demonstrate, indeed, that the specificity of the immunoproteasome and the constitutive proteasome differs. However, it has not yet been quantified how different the specificity of two forms of the proteasome are. The main question, which still lacks direct evidence, is whether the immunoproteasome generates more MHC ligands. Here we use bioinformatics tools to quantify these differences and show that the immunoproteasome is a more specific enzyme than the constitutive proteasome. Additionally, we predict the degradation of pathogen proteomes and find that the immunoproteasome generates peptides that are better ligands for MHC binding than peptides generated by the constitutive proteasome. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that the immunoproteasome has co-evolved with the major histocompatibility complex to optimize antigen presentation in vertebrate cells.},

	abstract = {Genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system encode cell-surface proteins involved in regulation of immune responses, and the way drugs interact with the HLA peptide binding groove is important in the immunopathogenesis of T-cell mediated drug hypersensitivity syndromes. Nevirapine (NVP), is an HIV-1 antiretroviral with treatment-limiting hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) associated with multiple class I and II HLA alleles. Here we utilize a novel analytical approach to explore these multi-allelic associations by systematically examining HLA molecules for similarities in peptide binding specificities and binding pocket structure. We demonstrate that primary predisposition to cutaneous NVP HSR, seen across ancestral groups, can be attributed to a cluster of HLA-C alleles sharing a common binding groove F pocket with HLA-C*04:01. An independent association with a group of class II alleles which share the HLA-DRB1-P4 pocket is also observed. In contrast, NVP HSR protection is afforded by a cluster of HLA-B alleles defined by a characteristic peptide binding groove B pocket. The results suggest drug-specific interactions within the antigen binding cleft can be shared across HLA molecules with similar binding pockets. We thereby provide an explanation for multiple HLA associations with cutaneous NVP HSR and advance insight into its pathogenic mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are the most polymorphic genes in the human genome. Almost all polymorphic residues are located in the peptide-binding groove, resulting in different peptide-binding preferences. Whether a single amino acid change can alter the peptide-binding repertoire of an HLA molecule has never been shown. To experimentally quantify the contribution of a single amino acid change to the peptide repertoire of even a single HLA molecule requires an immense number of HLA peptide-binding measurements. Therefore, we used an in silico method to study the effect of single mutations on the peptide repertoires. We predicted the peptide-binding repertoire of a large set of HLA molecules and used the overlap of the peptide-binding repertoires of each pair of HLA molecules that differ on a single position to measure how much single substitutions change the peptide binding. We found that the effect of a single substitution in the peptide-binding groove depends on the substituted position and the amino acids involved. The positions that alter peptide binding most are the most polymorphic ones, while those that are hardly variable among HLA molecules have the lowest effect on the peptide repertoire. Although expected, the relationship between functional divergence and polymorphism of HLA molecules has never been shown before. Additionally, we show that a single substitution in HLA-B molecules has more effect on the peptide-binding repertoire compared to that in HLA-A molecules. This provides an (alternative) explanation for the larger polymorphism of HLA-B molecules compared to HLA-A molecules.},

	abstract = {Classical MHC class I molecules (also known as MHC class Ia molecules) are extremely polymorphic. They are the main molecules that present pathogen-derived peptides to T cells, and they also interact with natural killer (NK)-cell receptors. By contrast, non-classical MHC class I molecules (also known as MHC class Ib molecules) are diverse in function and genetic relatedness, but each locus is oligomorphic.We distinguish between three loose groupings of MHC class Ib molecules. 'Young' molecules have only recently diverged from the MHC class Ia molecules of their taxonomic group, and they have many similar physical properties, including the ability to bind peptides. They differ mainly in terms of patterns of tissue expression and, sometimes, in their cellular trafficking. 'Middle-aged' molecules — such as H2–M3, Qa1 and HLA-E — seem to have arisen early in mammalian evolution. 'Old' molecules include molecules — such as CD1, and MICA (MHC-class-I-polypeptide-related sequence A) and MICB — that interact with NK-cell receptors and/or T-cell receptors (TCRs).The mouse molecule H2–M3 is specialized for binding N-formyl peptides, which are products of prokaryotic-type protein synthesis (by bacteria and mitochondria), but H2–M3 shows little specificity beyond this biochemical requirement. Such N-formyl peptides are rare in mammalian cells.H2–M3 must acquire its ligands intracellularly. Other MHC class I molecules can use weakly binding peptides to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and can exchange them for high-affinity peptides at the cell surface. There are few weak-binding peptides available to bind H2–M3, so it must wait in the ER.Positive selection of H2–M3-restricted T cells makes use of only a few mitochondrial peptides, but these can select a diverse group of T cells (which is known as the gemisch model).H2–M3-restricted CD8+ T cells are early responders in primary infection. For reasons that are not yet clear, these cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) appear 1 or 2 days earlier than MHC-class-Ia-restricted CTLs. There do not seem to be H2–M3-restricted memory CTLs, however, because MHC-class-Ia-restricted memory CTLs destroy the dendritic cells that would restimulate them.Qa1 and HLA-E (collectively denoted as QE in this article) are not closely related, but they have almost identical functions. QE molecules bind several unusual sets of peptides. Qa1 determinant modifier (Qdm) peptides derive from the signal peptides of other MHC class I molecules, and they are presented to TCRs and NK-cell receptors. Peptides derived from cytomegalovirus and other viruses mimic Qdm. Furthermore, peptides derived from stress-induced mitochondrial heat-shock protein 60 and bacterial GroEL are highly crossreactive, and their presentation in the context of Qa1 or HLA-E might lead to cross-protection and autoimmunity. Finally, at least some CD8+ T suppressor cells detect peptides derived from the variable region of the TCR β-chain (Vβ) of autoimmune CD4+ T cells, and these cells can suppress autoimmunity.Production of Qdm peptide involves signal-peptide peptidase (SPPase), which releases Qdm from the parent signal peptide into the cytoplasm, where it enters the canonical antigen-processing pathway. SPPase might also be important for processing other signal-peptide-derived epitopes.},

This size restriction is thought to operate mostly at the level of peptide-MHC class I interaction. Crystal structures have shown that the free N and C termini of a bound peptide interact through hydrogen bonding networks to conserved residues at either end of the class I binding site. Accordingly, it is thought that the termini are fixed and that only minor variations in peptide size are possible through a central bulging mechanism. We find that this consensus view is not always correct as some peptide-MHC class I interaction will accept significant extensions. Furthermore, our results indicate that in some cases protrusion, rather than bulging, may be the mechanism of extension. Depending upon the particular peptide-MHC combination in question, such extensions can occur at either the N or C terminus (but never both at the same time). Finally, we show that MHC and T cell in some cases can detect the identity of the extension, i.e. that extensions may be part of the specificity of the T cell immune response. We suggest that such extensions may play a physiological role.},

	abstract = {T cell-mediated immune recognition of peptides is initiated upon binding of the antigen receptor on T cells (TCR) to the peptide-MHC complex. TCRs are typically restricted by a particular MHC allele, while polymorphism within the MHC molecule can affect the spectrum of peptides that are bound and presented to the TCR. Classical MHC Class I molecules have a confined binding groove that restricts the length of the presented peptides to typically 8\&ndash;11 amino acids. Both N- and C-termini of the peptide are bound within binding pockets, allowing the TCR to dock in a diagonal orientation above the MHC-peptide complex. Longer peptides have been observed to bind either in a bulged or zig-zag orientation within the binding groove. More recently, unconventional peptide presentation has been reported for different MHC I molecules. Here, either N- or C-terminal amino acid additions to conventionally presented peptides induced a structural change either within the MHC I molecule that opened the confined binding groove or within the peptide itself, allowing the peptide ends to protrude into the solvent. Since both TCRs on T cells and killer immunoglobulin receptors on Natural Killer (NK) cells contact the MHC I molecule above or at the periphery of the peptide binding groove, unconventionally presented peptides could modulate both T cell and NK cell responses. We will highlight recent advances in our understanding of the functional consequences of unconventional peptide presentation in cellular immunity.},

The most important function of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule is in the induction, regulation of immune responses and the selection of the T cell repertoire. A clinician's attention is normally drawn to a system only when it malfunctions. The HLA system is no exception in this regard, but in contrast to other systems, it also arouses interest when it functions well – too well, in fact. Population studies carried out over the last several decades have identified a long list of human diseases that are significantly more common among individuals that carry particular HLA alleles including inflammatory, autoimmune and malignant disorders. HLA-disease association is the name of this phenomenon, and the mechanism underlying is still a subject of hot debate. Social behaviours are affected by HLA genes and preference for HLA disparate mates may provide ‘good genes’ for an individual's offspring. Also, certain HLA genes may be associated with shorter life and others with longer lifespan, but the effects depend both on the genetic background and on the environmental conditions. The following is a general overview of the important functional aspects of HLA in health and diseases.},

Understanding the molecular basis that governs TCR orientation over pMHC is still a considerable challenge. We present a simplified rigid approach applied on all non-redundant TCRpMHC crystal structures available. The CHARMM force field in combination with the FACTS implicit solvation model is used to study the role of long-distance interactions between the TCR and pMHC. We demonstrate that the sum of the coulomb interactions and the electrostatic solvation energies is sufficient to identify two orientations corresponding to energetic minima at 0° and 180° from the native orientation. Interestingly, these results are shown to be robust upon small structural variations of the TCR such as changes induced by Molecular Dynamics simulations, suggesting that shape complementarity is not required to obtain a reliable signal. Accurate energy minima are also identified by confronting unbound TCR crystal structures to pMHC. Furthermore, we decompose the electrostatic energy into residue contributions to estimate their role in the overall orientation. Results show that most of the driving force leading to the formation of the complex is defined by CDR1,2/MHC interactions. This long-distance contribution appears to be independent from the binding process itself, since it is reliably identified without considering neither short-range energy terms nor CDR induced fit upon binding. Ultimately, we present an attempt to predict the TCR/pMHC binding mode for a TCR structure obtained by homology modeling. The simplicity of the approach and the absence of any fitted parameters make it also easily applicable to other types of macromolecular protein complexes.},

In recent times, advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled the precise identification of these MHC-I peptides, wherein MS spectra are compared against a reference proteome. Unfortunately, matching these spectra to reference proteome databases is hindered by inflated search spaces attributed to a lack of enzyme restriction in the searches, limiting the efficiency with which MHC ligands are discovered. Here we offer a solution to this problem whereby we developed a targeted database search approach and accompanying tool SpectMHC, that is based on a priori-predicted MHC-I peptides. We first validated the approach using MS data from two different allotype-specific immunoprecipitates for the C57BL/6 mouse background. We then developed allotype-specific HLA databases to search previously published MS data sets of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This targeted search strategy improved peptide identifications for both mouse and human ligandomes by greater than 2-fold and is superior to traditional “no enzyme” searches of reference proteomes. Our targeted database search promises to uncover otherwise missed novel T-cell epitopes of therapeutic potential.},

	abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

	abstract = {We consider the task of estimating, from observed data, a probabilistic model that is parameterized by a finite number of parameters. In particular, we are considering the situation where the model probability density function is unnormalized. That is, the model is only specified up to the partition function. The partition function normalizes a model so that it integrates to one for any choice of the parameters. However, it is often impossible to obtain it in closed form. Gibbs distributions, Markov and multi-layer networks are examples of models where analytical normalization is often impossible. Maximum likelihood estimation can then not be used without resorting to numerical approximations which are often computationally expensive. We propose here a new objective function for the estimation of both normalized and unnormalized models. The basic idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise. With this approach, the normalizing partition function can be estimated like any other parameter. We prove that the new estimation method leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters. For large noise sample sizes, the new estimator is furthermore shown to behave like the maximum likelihood estimator. In the estimation of unnormalized models, there is a trade-off between statistical and computational performance. We show that the new method strikes a competitive trade-off in comparison to other estimation methods for unnormalized models. As an application to real data, we estimate novel two-layer models of natural image statistics with spline nonlinearities.},

However, it is often the case that the available training data are an incomplete set of positive examples, and a set of unlabeled examples, some of which are positive and some of which are negative. The problem solved in this paper is how to learn a standard binary classifier given a nontraditional training set of this nature. Under the assumption that the labeled examples are selected randomly from the positive examples, we show that a classifier trained on positive and unlabeled examples predicts probabilities that differ by only a constant factor from the true conditional probabilities of being positive. We show how to use this result in two different ways to learn a classifier from a nontraditional training set. We then apply these two new methods to solve a real-world problem: identifying protein records that should be included in an incomplete specialized molecular biology database. Our experiments in this domain show that models trained using the new methods perform better than the current state-of-the-art biased SVM method for learning from positive and unlabeled examples.},

	abstract = {Nine philosophers explore the various issues and questions raised by the newly released language model, GPT-3, in this edition of Philosophers On, guest edited by Annette Zimmermann. Introduction Annette Zimmermann, guest editor GPT-3, a powerful, 175 billion parameter language model developed recently by OpenAI, has been galvanizing public debate and controversy. As the MIT Technology Review puts it: “OpenAI’s new language generator GPT-3 is shockingly good—and completely mindless”. Parts of the technology community hope (and fear) that GPT-3 could brings us one step closer to the hypothetical future possibility of human-like, highly sophisticated artificial general intelligence (AGI). Meanwhile, others (including OpenAI’s own CEO) have critiqued claims about GPT-3’s ostensible proximity to AGI, arguing that they are vastly overstated. Why the hype? As is turns out, GPT-3 is unlike other natural language processing (NLP) systems, the latter of which often struggle with what comes comparatively easily to humans: performing entirely new language tasks based on a few simple instructions and examples. Instead, NLP systems usually have to be pre-trained on a large corpus of text, and then fine-tuned in order to successfully perform a specific task. GPT-3, by contrast, does not require fine tuning of this kind: it seems to be able to perform a whole range of tasks reasonably well, from producing fiction, poetry, and press releases to functioning code, and from music, jokes, and technical manuals, to “news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans”. The Philosophers On series contains group posts on issues of current interest, with the aim being to show what the careful thinking characteristic of philosophers (and occasionally scholars in related fields) can bring to popular ongoing conversations. Contributors present not fully worked out position papers but rather brief thoughts that can serve as prompts for further reflection and discussion. The contributors to this installment of “Philosophers On” are Amanda Askell (Research Scientist, OpenAI), David Chalmers (Professor of Philosophy, New York University), Justin Khoo (Associate Professor of Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Carlos Montemayor (Professor of Philosophy, San Francisco State University), C.

A novel input representation has been developed consisting of a combination of sparse encoding, Blosum encoding, and input derived from hidden Markov models. We demonstrate that the combination of several neural networks derived using different sequence-encoding schemes has a performance superior to neural networks derived using a single sequence-encoding scheme. The new method is shown to have a performance that is substantially higher than that of other methods. By use of mutual information calculations we show that peptides that bind to the HLA A*0204 complex display signal of higher order sequence correlations. Neural networks are ideally suited to integrate such higher order correlations when predicting the binding affinity. It is this feature combined with the use of several neural networks derived from different and novel sequence-encoding schemes and the ability of the neural network to be trained on data consisting of continuous binding affinities that gives the new method an improved performance. The difference in predictive performance between the neural network methods and that of the matrix-driven methods is found to be most significant for peptides that bind strongly to the HLA molecule, confirming that the signal of higher order sequence correlation is most strongly present in high-binding peptides. Finally, we use the method to predict T-cell epitopes for the genome of hepatitis C virus and discuss possible applications of the prediction method to guide the process of rational vaccine design.},

binding to MHC class I molecules is the single most selective
step in antigen presentation and the strongest single correlate to
peptide cellular immunogenicity. The cost of experimentally characterizing
the rules of peptide presentation for a given MHC-I molecule is extensive,
and predictors of peptide–MHC interactions constitute an attractive
alternative. Recently, an increasing amount of MHC presented peptides
identified by mass spectrometry (MS ligands) has been published. Handling
and interpretation of MS ligand data is, in general, challenging due
to the polyspecificity nature of the data. We here outline a general
pipeline for dealing with this challenge and accurately annotate ligands
to the relevant MHC-I molecule they were eluted from by use of GibbsClustering
and binding motif information inferred from in silico models. We illustrate
the approach here in the context of MHC-I molecules (BoLA) of cattle.
Next, we demonstrate how such annotated BoLA MS ligand data can readily
be integrated with in vitro binding affinity data in a prediction
model with very high and unprecedented performance for identification
of BoLA-I restricted T-cell epitopes. The prediction model is freely
available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan/NetBoLApan. The approach has here been applied to the BoLA-I system, but the
pipeline is readily applicable to MHC systems in other species.},

	abstract = {T-cell development and function are regulated by MHC-associated self peptides, collectively referred to as the immunopeptidome. Large-scale mass spectrometry studies have highlighted three key features of the immunopeptidome. First, it is not a mirror of the proteome or the transcriptome, and its content cannot be predicted with currently available bioinformatic tools. Second, the immunopeptidome is more plastic than previously anticipated, and is molded by several cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors. Finally, the complexity of the immunopeptidome goes beyond the 20-amino acids alphabet encoded in the germline, and is not restricted to canonical reading frames. The large amounts of ‘dark matter’ in the immunopeptidome, such as polymorphic, cryptic and mutant peptides, can now be explored using novel proteogenomic approaches that combine mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing.},

	abstract = {Prediction of HLA binding affinity is widely utilized to identify candidate T cell epitopes, and an affinity of 500 nM is routinely used as a threshold for peptide selection. However, the fraction (\%) of peptides predicted to bind with affinities of 500 nM varies by allele. For example, of a large collection of about 30,000 dengue virus derived peptides only 0.3\% were predicted to bind HLA A*0101, while nearly 5\% were predicted for A*0201. This striking difference could not be ascribed to variation in accuracy of the algorithms utilized, as predicted values closely correlated with affinity measured in vitro with purified HLA molecules. These data raised the question whether different alleles would also vary in terms of epitope repertoire size, defined as the number of associated epitopes or, alternatively, whether alleles vary drastically in terms of the affinity threshold associated with immunogenicity. To address this issue, strains of HLA transgenic mice with wide (A*0201), intermediate (B*0702) or narrow (A*0101) repertoires were immunized with peptides of varying binding affinity and relative percentile ranking. The results show that absolute binding capacity is a better predictor of immunogenicity, and analysis of epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) revealed that predictive efficacy is increased using allele-specific affinity thresholds. Finally, we investigate the genetic and structural basis of the phenomenon. While no stringent correlate was defined, on average HLA B alleles are associated with significantly narrower repertoires than HLA A alleles.},

To date, large-scale identification of (neo-)Ags from DNA sequencing data has mainly relied on predictions. In parallel, mass spectrometry analysis of HLA peptidome is increasingly performed to directly detect peptides presented on HLA molecules. In this study, we use a novel unsupervised approach to assign mass spectrometry–based HLA peptidomics data to their cognate HLA molecules. We show that incorporation of deconvoluted HLA peptidomics data in ligand prediction algorithms can improve their accuracy for HLA alleles with few ligands in existing databases. The results of our computational analysis of large datasets of naturally processed HLA peptides, together with experimental validation and protein structure analysis, further reveal how HLA-binding motifs change with peptide length and predict new cooperative effects between distant residues in HLA-B07:02 ligands.},

Although low levels of soluble HLA molecules (sHLA) are normally released into the blood, many types of tumor cells release larger amounts of these sHLA molecules, presumably to counter immune surveillance by T cells. Here we demonstrate that these sHLA molecules are still bound with their authentic peptide repertoires, similar to those of the membranal HLA molecules (mHLA). Therefore, a single immunoaffinity purification of the plasma sHLA molecules, starting with a few milliliters of patients’ blood, allows for identification of very large sHLA peptidomes by mass spectrometry, forming a foundation for development of a simple and universal blood-based cancer diagnosis. The new methodology was validated using plasma and tumor cells of multiple-myeloma and leukemia patients, plasma of healthy controls, and with cultured cancer cells. The analyses identified thousands of sHLA peptides, including some cancer-related peptides, present among the sHLA peptidomes of the cancer patients. Furthermore, because the HLA peptides are the degradation products of the cellular proteins, this sHLA peptidomics approach opens the way for investigation of the patterns of protein synthesis and degradation within the tumor cells.},

The peptide repertoire of a specific molecule is to a large extent determined by the molecular structure accommodating so-called main anchor positions of the presented peptide. These receptors are extremely polymorphic, and much of the polymorphism influences the peptide-binding repertoire. However, despite this polymorphism, class I molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires. Almost a decade ago we introduced this concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and defined nine different groups, denominated as supertypes, on the basis of their main anchor specificity. The utility of this original supertype classification, as well several other subsequent arrangements derived by others, has been demonstrated in a large number of epitope identification studies.},

Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them.},

Recent years brought increased interest in applying machine learning techniques to difficult “real-world” problems, many of which are characterized by imbalanced data. Additionally the distribution of the testing data may differ from that of the training data, and the true misclassification costs may be unknown at learning time. Predictive accuracy, a popular choice for evaluating performance of a classifier, might not be appropriate when the data is imbalanced and/or the costs of different errors vary markedly.

	abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

	abstract = {There are several aspects that might influence the performance achieved by existing learning systems. It has been reported that one of these aspects is related to class imbalance in which examples in training data belonging to one class heavily outnumber the examples in the other class. In this situation, which is found in real world data describing an infrequent but important event, the learning system may have difficulties to learn the concept related to the minority class. In this work we perform a broad experimental evaluation involving ten methods, three of them proposed by the authors, to deal with the class imbalance problem in thirteen UCI data sets. Our experiments provide evidence that class imbalance does not systematically hinder the performance of learning systems. In fact, the problem seems to be related to learning with too few minority class examples in the presence of other complicating factors, such as class overlapping. Two of our proposed methods deal with these conditions directly, allying a known over-sampling method with data cleaning methods in order to produce better-defined class clusters. Our comparative experiments show that, in general, over-sampling methods provide more accurate results than under-sampling methods considering the area under the ROC curve (AUC). This result seems to contradict results previously published in the literature. Two of our proposed methods, Smote + Tomek and Smote + ENN, presented very good results for data sets with a small number of positive examples. Moreover, Random over-sampling, a very simple over-sampling method, is very competitive to more complex over-sampling methods. Since the over-sampling methods provided very good performance results, we also measured the syntactic complexity of the decision trees induced from over-sampled data. Our results show that these trees are usually more complex then the ones induced from original data. Random over-sampling usually produced the smallest increase in the mean number of induced rules and Smote + ENN the smallest increase in the mean number of conditions per rule, when compared among the investigated over-sampling methods.},

The height of each letter is made proportional to Its frequency, and the letters are sorted so the most common one is on top. The height of the entire stack is then adjusted to signify the information content of the sequences at that position. From these ‘sequence logos’, one can determine not only the consensus sequence but also the relative frequency of bases and the information content (measured In bits) at every position in a site or sequence.

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of binding between a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allele and a peptide plays a major role in the synthesis of personalized cancer vaccines. The immune system struggles to distinguish between a cancerous and a healthy cell. In a patient suffering from cancer who has a particular MHC allele, only those peptides that bind with the MHC allele with high affinity, help the immune system recognize the cancerous cells.MHCAttnNet is a deep neural model that uses an attention mechanism to capture the relevant subsequences of the amino acid sequences of peptides and MHC alleles. It then uses this to accurately predict the MHC-peptide binding. MHCAttnNet achieves an AUC-PRC score of 94.18\% with 161 class I MHC alleles, which outperforms the state-of-the-art models for this task. MHCAttnNet also achieves a better F1-score in comparison to the state-of-the-art models while covering a larger number of class II MHC alleles. The attention mechanism used by MHCAttnNet provides a heatmap over the amino acids thus indicating the important subsequences present in the amino acid sequence. This approach also allows us to focus on a much smaller number of relevant trigrams corresponding to the amino acid sequence of an MHC allele, from 9251 possible trigrams to about 258. This significantly reduces the number of amino acid subsequences that need to be clinically tested.The data and source code are available at https://github.com/gopuvenkat/MHCAttnNet.},

Vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells may thus be the main mediators of protection at this early stage7,8. The details of their induction, comparison to natural infection, and association with other arms of vaccine-induced immunity remain, however, incompletely understood. We show on a single epitope level that a stable and fully functional CD8+ T cell response is vigorously mobilized one week after bnt162b2 prime vaccination when circulating CD4+ T cells and neutralizing antibodies are still weakly detectable. Boost vaccination induced a robust expansion generating highly differentiated effector CD8+ T cells; however, neither the functional capacity nor the memory precursor T cell pool was affected. Compared to natural infection, vaccine-induced early memory T cells exhibited similar functional capacities but a different subset distribution. Our results indicate that CD8+ T cells are important effector cells, expanded in the early protection window after prime vaccination, precede maturation of other effector arms of vaccine-induced immunity and are stably maintained after boost vaccination.},

Immunotherapy has shown remarkable efficacy in the treatment of cancer in the past few decades. The success of immune checkpoint blockade targeting CTLA-4, PD-1 and PDL1 has led to a breakthrough in tumor immunotherapy. However, the overall response rate is not high, and only a part of cancer patients benefit. A growing number of studies have highlighted the relationship between neoantigens and T cells' recognition of cancer cells. Tumor neoantigens are abundantly expressed only in tumor cells with strong immunogenicity and tumor heterogeneity. As a new tumor immunotherapy method, vaccines developed for neoantigens have been used in clinical trials of various solid tumors. In this review, we summarized the latest advances in the classification of immunotherapy and the process of classification, identification and synthesis of tumor-specific neoantigens, as well as their role in current cancer immunotherapy. Finally, the application prospects and existing problems of neoantigens were discussed.},

These viruses utilize a whole variety of ingenious strategies to inhibit the MHC class I pathway. Viral proteins have been characterized that exploit bottlenecks in the MHC class I pathway, such as peptide translocation by the transporter associated with antigen processing. Alternatively, viral proteins can cause the degradation or mislocalization of MHC class I molecules. This is often achieved by the subversion of the host cell's own protein degradation and trafficking pathways. As a consequence elucidation of how these viral proteins act to subvert host cell function will continue to give important insights not only into virus–host interactions but also the function and mechanism of cellular pathways.},

	abstract = {T-cell-specific immunity functions in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent manner. MHC molecules present antigenic peptides on the surface of cells to be recognised by specific T-cells. MHC class I and class II molecules possess highly similar structural features used to load peptides. Specifically, both contain peptide-binding grooves formed by two α-helices and eight β-strands. In the peptide-binding groove, specific amino acids compose pockets that accommodate the corresponding side chains of the anchor residues of the presented peptides. Peptide-binding preferences exist among different alleles of both of MHC I and MHC II molecules, which are mainly dependent on amino acid polymorphisms in the peptide-binding grooves of MHC chains. Aside from the common binding of peptides to MHC molecules, the currently determined structures of post-translationally modified peptides to MHC molecules demonstrate that the modified groups have important roles in the peptide–MHC interaction. The illumination of the binding features of peptides to MHC molecules has aided our understanding of T-cell-specific immunity and the development of T-cell epitope-related vaccines. Key Concepts: MHC I and class II molecules fold into a highly similar conformations featuring a peptide-binding groove to present T-cell epitopes. Peptide-binding grooves of MHC I molecules are composed of two α-helices and eight β-strands formed by one heavy chain, while MHC II uses two domains from different chains to construct the peptide-binding groove. Peptides bind to MHC molecules through primary and secondary anchor residues protruding into the pockets in the peptide-binding grooves. Peptide preferences are dependent on the amino acids polymorphisms comprising the anchor pockets, which are related to the various alleles of MHC. The conformations of peptides presented by MHC I molecules are length-dependant. The modified groups of post-translationally modified peptides have important roles in the peptide–MHC interaction. MHC is called HLA, human leucocyte antigen, in human; H-2 in mice.},

Furthermore, we propose a neural network-based permutation-invariant aggregation operator that corresponds to the attention mechanism. Notably, an application of the proposed attention-based operator provides insight into the contribution of each instance to the bag label. We show empirically that our approach achieves comparable performance to the best MIL methods on benchmark MIL datasets and it outperforms other methods on a MNIST-based MIL dataset and two real-life histopathology datasets without sacrificing interpretability.},

In such circumstances, one question of practical importance is: if only n training examples can be selected, in what proportion should the classes be represented? In this article we help to answer this question by analyzing, for a fixed training-set size, the relationship between the class distribution of the training data and the performance of classification trees induced from these data. We study twenty-six data sets and, for each, determine the best class distribution for learning. The naturally occurring class distribution is shown to generally perform well when classifier performance is evaluated using undifferentiated error rate (0/1 loss). However, when the area under the ROC curve is used to evaluate classifier performance, a balanced distribution is shown to perform well. Since neither of these choices for class distribution always generates the best-performing classifier, we introduce a “budget-sensitive” progressive sampling algorithm for selecting training examples based on the class associated with each example. An empirical analysis of this algorithm shows that the class distribution of the resulting training set yields classifiers with good (nearly-optimal) classification performance.},

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O(\$L{\textasciicircum}2\$) to O(\$L {\textbackslash}log L\$), where \$L\$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of N times, where N is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},
